Volunteering is an ideal way to do good for others in your community. It gives you experience, brings people together, promotes personal and professional growth, and many more other advantages.

Since I started graduate school at Iowa State University in Spring 2020, I volunteered for the following organizations:

- Served as Student Moderator in oral presentations at the 77th SWCS International Annual Conference in Denver Colorado from July 31 – August 3, 2022.

- Served on the Story County Water Quality Monitoring Program from October 2020- October 2021 performing water sampling for chemical monitoring at South Skunk River, Ames, Iowa.

- Served as Tech volunteer and moderator at the 75th SWCS International Annual Conference virtually from July 27 – July 29, 2020
